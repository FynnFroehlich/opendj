# OpenDJ

Let's apply Open Source principles to the Dance Floor! 
 
We hack a Cloud Native App which Users can use to "push" their favorite music (via link sharing from spotify, google music etc). The "maintainer's"  curate the list of songs ("sort/group them by style, bpm etc). The list is played through a backend-device (e.g. raspberry attached to the PA). A list can be "forked", when the maintainer do a bad job. The fork with the most contributors is being played.
