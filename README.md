# OpenDJ -Apply Open Source principles to the Dance Floor! 

## Vision
Have you ever been at an event and disliked the music being played?
The vision of OpenDJ is to solve this problem by applying open source principles to the music playlist of an event.
Participants can add tracks to the playlist of an event. Curators can edit the playlist (sorting/grouping by genre, deleting) - they are like the maintainer of an open source project.
The music is being played by a streaming provider, e.g. Spotify.

Everybody can add the the playlist, no accounts needed, no access to local devices. OpenDJ is running in the internet and uses streaming provider APIs to execute the playlist on a local device (which might be connected to the PA system of a party location)

## Try it out
A prototype is up and running: www.opendj.io
You can add one of the following tracks by pasting the ID into the "Add" Dialog:
- spotify:track:6JEK0CvvjDjjMUBFoXShNZ
- spotify:track:4u7EnebtmKWzUH433cf5Qv
- spotify:track:6h9AH81lpDbjcsBz2ClqAE

The music provider is only a mockup, current track finishes playing after 21 seconds. Add several tracks and see how they vanish.
