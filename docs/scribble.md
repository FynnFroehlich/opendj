## Architecture Questions:


### Service Discovery: 
Description: 
How does a frontend service find out which backend services exist and which endpoints they have?  

Example: How does the EventService find out, which musicproviders are avail?
Could be backend-spotify, backend-soundclound, backend-itunes, or non of these.

Ideas:
- Option **A**: Env Variables
- Option **B**: some service discovery framework
- Option **C**: query k8s for existing routes/services
- Option **D**: Kafka-Topic  
    Have a topic where each service provider publishes an event with his name, endpoint urls (internal as xxx.svc.local and external via ocp router), versions etc..  
    The event is published every time a pod is started or every 12 hours. Thus consumers can read the topic -12 hours and know who might be there. To get final confidence, consumer can call the /health endpoint to verify - *et voil√°*.  
- Option **E**: Use only async event communications, then the only service needed would be the event bus endpoint, which could be in an env variable.


### Service Versioning
How do we handle service versioning.
Idea:
- use ..../v1  in path (like k8s does) until there is a breaking change. then increase to v2
- avoid breaking changes like hell - no mandatory fields in any api or event!


- Principal: No breaking changes
- Principal: no mandatory fields in messages.
